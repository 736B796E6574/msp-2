# Elephant

Elephant is a flip-the-card style memory game. The aim of the game is to flip 2 cards and hopefully find a pair. When you find all of the pairs the game is over and you have won. This quicker you win the better you played. This is measured in moves made and with a timer. 

The game is not very difficult and is aimed at people of all ages that have a few minutes to kill.
